## Configuration

The NPC uses several configuration parameters that can be adjusted in the code:

```lua
local TACTICAL_CONFIG = {
    STEALTH_RADIUS = 800,           -- Detection radius
    ENGAGEMENT_RANGE = 400,         -- Optimal engagement distance
    TAKEDOWN_RANGE = 100,          -- Silent takedown range
    WEAPON_RANGE = 500,             -- Maximum weapon range
    ACCURACY_DECAY = 0.1,           -- Accuracy loss per shot
    RECOVERY_TIME = 2.0,            -- Accuracy recovery time
    CLOAK_LIGHT_THRESHOLD = 0.3,    -- Light level for cloak activation
    DECOY_COOLDOWN = 30,            -- Decoy cooldown time
    STRAFE_SPEED = 150,             -- Strafing speed during combat
    AIM_TIME = 1.0,                 -- Time to aim before shooting
    MAX_SPREAD = 200,               -- Maximum shot spread
    MIN_SPREAD = 50                 -- Minimum shot spread
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Model Not Loading**: Ensure the Splinter Cell model is installed
2. **T-Posing**: The animation system should prevent this, but if it occurs, try respawning the NPC
3. **Weapon Not Visible**: Check that the weapon model exists in your server

### Performance
- The NPC uses efficient pathfinding and AI cycles
- Animation updates are optimized for smooth performance
- Weapon rendering is handled efficiently
