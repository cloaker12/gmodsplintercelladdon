# Splinter Cell Vision Goggles - Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the Splinter Cell Vision Goggles SWEP to ensure thermal mode, sonar mode detection works properly and that you can see clearly in night environments.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Thermal Mode Detection Fixed ✅
- **Problem**: Thermal vision was checking line-of-sight, preventing heat signature detection through walls
- **Solution**: Removed line-of-sight restrictions so thermal vision now properly detects heat signatures through walls (like real thermal imaging)
- **Enhancement**: Increased detection range to 800 units and improved heat signature rendering with more detailed visualization
- **Features**:
  - Players and NPCs show detailed thermal signatures with head, body, and limb heat maps
  - Vehicles show engine heat blocks
  - Weapons and hot objects display appropriate heat signatures
  - Distance-based intensity scaling for realistic thermal fade

### 2. Sonar Mode Detection Enhanced ✅
- **Problem**: Missing client-side detection functions and limited entity detection
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive `IsSonarDetectable()` function on both client and server
- **Enhancement**: Expanded detection criteria to include more entity types
- **Features**:
  - Detects through walls (true sonar behavior)
  - Enhanced entity types: players, NPCs, weapons, vehicles, physics props, doors, items, functional entities
  - Lowered size threshold for prop detection (20 units vs 30)
  - Added debug feedback showing detection counts
  - Color-coded indicators: orange for entities behind walls, blue for line-of-sight

### 3. Night Vision Visibility Dramatically Improved ✅
- **Problem**: Night vision was too dark and didn't provide enough brightness for dark environments
- **Solution**: Complete overhaul of the night vision rendering system
- **Enhancements**:
  - Added 5 brightness enhancement layers (vs previous 3)
  - Additional gamma correction overlays for very dark areas
  - Center focus enhancement for better visibility
  - Reduced grain effect opacity for better clarity
  - Less intrusive scan lines (every 4 pixels vs 3)
  - Multiple brightness boost overlays with varying intensities

### 4. Networking Issues Resolved ✅
- **Problem**: Inconsistent variable names and poor synchronization between client/server
- **Solution**: Standardized all references to use `GogglesActive` instead of mixed `GogglesEnabled`/`GogglesActive`
- **Enhancement**: Added periodic network synchronization to ensure client stays updated
- **Features**:
  - Consistent variable naming throughout codebase
  - Proper network message handling
  - Automatic synchronization every 1 second when goggles are active
  - Fixed key input handling to use proper KEY_N and KEY_T constants

### 5. Enhanced Debugging Tools Added ✅
- **New Commands**:
  - `splintercell_debug_server` - Shows server-side state information
  - `splintercell_force_pulse` - Manually trigger sonar pulse for testing
  - `splintercell_test_detection` - Test thermal and sonar detection in current area
  - `splintercell_thermal_debug` - Debug thermal detection with entity lists
  - `splintercell_sonar_debug` - Debug sonar detection with active detections
  - `splintercell_spawn_test_npc` - Spawn test NPCs for thermal testing
  - `splintercell_spawn_sonar_test` - Spawn various entities for sonar testing

## Technical Improvements

### Client-Side Enhancements
- Added missing `IsThermalDetectable()` and `IsSonarDetectable()` functions
- Improved thermal rendering with through-wall detection
- Enhanced night vision with multiple brightness layers
- Better HUD debug information showing detection counts
- Consistent variable naming and state management

### Server-Side Enhancements  
- Improved sonar pulse system with detection feedback
- Enhanced entity detection criteria
- Added comprehensive debug commands
- Better networking with periodic synchronization
- Expanded detection range and sensitivity

### Shared Improvements
- Consistent key handling using proper KEY constants
- Better energy management system
- Enhanced settings synchronization
- Improved entity detection algorithms

## How to Test

1. **Spawn the weapon**: Use the spawn menu to get "Splinter Cell Goggles"
2. **Test Night Vision**: Press `N` to activate, mode 1 should now be much brighter in dark areas
3. **Test Thermal Vision**: Press `T` to cycle to mode 2, should detect entities through walls
4. **Test Sonar Vision**: Press `T` to cycle to mode 3, should show pulsing detection through walls
5. **Debug Commands**: Use the new console commands to troubleshoot any issues

### Key Bindings
- `N` - Toggle goggles on/off
- `T` - Cycle through vision modes (Night Vision → Thermal → Sonar)
- `Primary Attack` - Also toggles goggles
- `Secondary Attack` - Also cycles modes

## Expected Behavior

### Night Vision (Mode 1)
- Bright green overlay with excellent visibility in dark environments
- Subtle grain effect and scan lines for authentic feel
- Multiple brightness enhancement layers
- Center focus enhancement

### Thermal Vision (Mode 2) 
- Dark blue/black background (cold areas)
- White-hot signatures for living entities (players/NPCs)
- Orange signatures for vehicles and hot objects
- Yellow signatures for weapons
- Works through walls with distance-based intensity
- Real-time entity count display

### Sonar Vision (Mode 3)
- Dark blue overlay with pulse rings
- Expanding sonar pulse effect from center
- Entity highlighting with type indicators (P=Player, N=NPC, W=Weapon, etc.)
- Orange highlighting for entities behind walls
- Blue highlighting for line-of-sight entities
- Real-time detection count and pulse timer display

All modes now work significantly better with proper entity detection, improved visibility, and reliable networking.
