# DarkRP Goggles Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Client-Server Synchronization Problems**
- **Problem**: Vision effects were purely client-side, causing desync in DarkRP
- **Solution**: Added proper server-side state management using NWVars
- **Changes**: 
  - Added `SetNWBool("VisionActive")` and `SetNWInt("VisionMode")` for server state
  - Client now syncs with server state in `Think()` function

### 2. **Missing Network Communication** 
- **Problem**: No networking between client and server for DarkRP validation
- **Solution**: Added proper net messages for vision control
- **Changes**:
  - Added `SC_VisionToggle`, `SC_VisionModeChange`, `SC_VisionState` net messages
  - Server validates permissions before allowing vision changes

### 3. **DarkRP Permission System**
- **Problem**: No job-based permission checking for vision access
- **Solution**: Added `CanUseVision()` function with DarkRP job validation
- **Changes**:
  - Checks if player's current job has `splinter_cell_vision` weapon
  - Fallback to admin permission check

### 4. **Weapon State Management**
- **Problem**: Vision state not properly handled during weapon deploy/holster
- **Solution**: Enhanced Deploy/Holster functions with DarkRP compatibility
- **Changes**:
  - Auto-sync client state on weapon deploy
  - Clean server state on weapon holster
  - Proper cleanup in OnRemove

### 5. **Job Integration Hooks**
- **Problem**: No automatic weapon distribution when joining Splinter Cell jobs
- **Solution**: Added DarkRP hooks for seamless job integration
- **Changes**:
  - `playerBoughtCustomJob` hook gives weapon automatically
  - `OnPlayerChangedTeam` hook removes weapon when leaving job

## How to Test

1. **Join DarkRP server with this addon installed**
2. **Become Splinter Cell Operative job** (F4 menu → Special Forces → Splinter Cell Operative)
3. **Verify you receive the goggles automatically**
4. **Test vision controls**:
   - Press `N` to toggle vision on/off
   - Press `T` to cycle between vision modes
   - Use chat commands `/togglevision` and `/cyclevision` as backup
5. **Change to a different job and verify goggles are removed**

## Key Improvements

- ✅ **Server-side validation** ensures DarkRP compatibility
- ✅ **Job-based permissions** prevent unauthorized access
- ✅ **Automatic weapon management** on job changes
- ✅ **Proper state synchronization** between client and server
- ✅ **Fallback chat commands** for additional reliability
- ✅ **Admin override** capabilities maintained

## Files Modified

1. `lua/weapons/splinter_cell_vision.lua` - Main weapon file with networking fixes
2. `lua/darkrp_customthings/splinter_commands.lua` - Added DarkRP integration hooks
3. `lua/darkrp_customthings/jobs.lua` - Job definitions (unchanged, working correctly)

The goggles should now work perfectly in DarkRP while maintaining job restrictions and proper server-client synchronization.
